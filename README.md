FormHome.java is part of the form package and creates a visually appealing dashboard with three informational cards and a table displaying employee data. The class leverages custom Swing components (like Model_Card and TableHome) to enhance the UI. The background is set using an image, and the layout is organized with JLayeredPane and PanelBoarder for a clean, modern look. The code also includes methods to dynamically update user information and add rows to the table.
