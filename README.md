ExAdmins.java is responsible for validating user login credentials. It establishes a connection to the database using JDBC with integrated security and executes a prepared SQL query to check if the provided username and password match a record in the Admin table. The validateLogin method returns true if the credentials are valid and false otherwise. Error handling is implemented to manage SQL exceptions, and resources like Connection, PreparedStatement, and ResultSet are properly closed in the finally block to prevent memory leaks.
NewAdmins.java handles the registration of new users by inserting their details into the Admin table. The Addmin method constructs an SQL INSERT query dynamically using the NewUser object's properties (name, password, email, gender, and phone number). It also includes debug statements to log the query and the number of affected rows. After insertion, the method retrieves and displays all admin records for verification. Like ExAdmins, it uses JDBC for database connectivity and includes error handling for SQLException and ClassNotFoundException. However, it employs a Statement instead of a PreparedStatement, which could expose the system to SQL injection risks if user inputs are not sanitized.
